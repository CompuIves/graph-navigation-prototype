# graph-navigation-prototype

Explorations in adding interactive features to make the graph-driven data exploration process better.

## Setup

First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Exploring

- Change the line in `src/getData.js` to switch which dataset is being loaded in
- In the future, we might add a dropdown menu to let you change this, but it wasn't worth it on the first pass

You should be able to browse the app by visiting `localhost:3000`.

## Documentation

- Add workspace links
- Add codepen links
- Add GIF of the thing working

## Team

Code developed in tandem with Emily Pan, with feedback from Kay Dobesh, Ashley Miller, Marc Weisman, Joe McCourt, and Jon Gala.
